# AWS EC2 Hands On Practice

This section documents my practical hands on work with AWS EC2.
The objective was to understand EC2 by performing real tasks on a cloud server.

## What I Worked On

I worked on the following EC2 concepts practically.

EC2 overview and instance concept  
Instance types and selection  
Launching an EC2 instance  
Key pair creation and usage  
Security group configuration  
SSH into EC2  
Running Python scripts on EC2  
Installing Python libraries  
Using Python virtual environments  
Stopping and terminating EC2 instances  
Cost awareness basics  

## Practical Steps Performed

I launched an Ubuntu EC2 instance from the AWS Console.  
I selected a micro instance type for cost efficient learning.  
I created and downloaded a key pair for secure access.  
I configured the security group to allow SSH access.  
I connected to the instance using SSH from my local machine.  
I verified Python installation on EC2.  
I created and ran a Python file directly on the EC2 server.  
I installed pip and Python libraries.  
I used a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies.  
I stopped and terminated the instance to avoid unnecessary cost.

## Technologies Used

AWS EC2  
Ubuntu Linux  
Python 3  
SSH  

## Screenshots

All screenshots related to this EC2 practice are available in the screenshots folder.
They demonstrate EC2 launch, SSH access, Python execution, library installation, and instance lifecycle management.

## Learning Outcome

This hands on practice helped me understand how EC2 works in real world scenarios.
I gained experience in managing cloud servers, running applications, and following cost efficient practices.
