# AWS EC2 Hands On Project

This repository documents my hands on experience with AWS EC2.  
The focus of this project is to understand EC2 by performing real practical tasks instead of only theoretical learning.

---

## Overview

Amazon EC2 provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud.  
In this project, I launched an EC2 instance, connected to it securely, ran Python scripts, installed libraries, and managed instance cost.

---

## Topics Covered

• What EC2 is and how instances work  
• Instance types and selection  
• Launching an EC2 instance  
• Key pair and security group configuration  
• SSH into EC2  
• Running Python scripts on EC2  
• Installing Python libraries  
• Using Python virtual environments  
• Stopping vs terminating instances  
• Cost awareness basics

## Hands On Steps Performed

1. Launched an Ubuntu EC2 instance using AWS Console  
2. Selected a micro instance type for cost efficient learning  
3. Created and downloaded a key pair for secure access  
4. Configured security group to allow SSH access  
5. Connected to EC2 instance using SSH  
6. Verified Python installation on EC2  
7. Created and executed a Python script  
8. Installed pip and Python libraries  
9. Used a virtual environment to manage dependencies  
10. Stopped and terminated the instance to control cost

## Technologies Used

• AWS EC2  
• Ubuntu Linux  
• Python 3  
• SSH  
• GitHub

## Screenshots

All screenshots related to this project are available in the `screenshots` folder.  
They demonstrate EC2 launch success, SSH connection, Python execution, library installation, and virtual environment usage.

## Learning Outcome

This project helped me gain real world experience with cloud servers.  
I now understand how to work with EC2 instances, manage environments, and follow cost efficient practices.

This repository serves as proof of my hands on experience with AWS EC2.
